## NOTE: This Hack is a Decomp.
# About:
Master64 made with Alpha-style beta hack for decomp _(cancelled)_, I started development in Early May 2022.
I made up the some doing random thing stuff this hack.
## Before the start of development:

So why liked this name hack called **"Master64"**
for me?

this Master64 hack feels like testing out and putting some random crap thing stuff
for private purposes?

_**(example: for making a video showcase test cool 3-D	 Mario realistic model beta)**_


And... I said for thinking in my mind _"Nevermind... Time to make an alpha hack with refresh 15 decomp"_


Turns out refresh 15 decomp is 
not recommended for making beta hacks.

Errors are going on here with
something wrong refresh 15 for beta hacks
and works fine.


I'll use refresh 13 is recommended for
making beta hacks will be soon
in this making for the new hack.

But, In Late May 2022 I released this pre-alpha joke hack video following the video looks like hypercam nostalgia parody.
